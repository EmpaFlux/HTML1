                </div>
                <p> I am currently studying .Net development on my first year here in Gothenburg at IT-Högskolan,
                   with the end goal of having the skills to be a full stack web developer upon graduation.
                   The skills that we learn is primarily programing in C#, handling databases (Microsoft SQL, MongoDB, Azure Cosmos)
                    and working with front end development (HTML, CSS and soon JavaScript).</p>
                <p>I also have previously studied Gamewriting at the University of Skövde, and is enrolled in a game development studio
                 that we started during school there, and we are currently in pre-production for our second title. The skills I gained there and are currently using in
                  our company is primarily focused on narrative design, experimental storytelling, content writing (dialog, in-game text, barks etc) and character/world design. </p>

                <ul>
                   <li> Bleeper
                      <p>A game about censorship, freedom of speech and exploding bicycles. Our first game as a studio and currently in the process of being completed.
                        I have a position as the lead writer for the group and worked with two other game writers to deliver content to the game, and coordinated with production,
                         graphics and sound leads to ensure that all departments stayed in the loop.

                   <li> Marvinter
                      <p>A game made for and based on the swedish radio calendar under the same name. I was involved in its development in a collaboration between Sveriges radio and
                         Högskolan i Skövde as a level designer and game writer, although on a small scale. In the end my designs were chosen and included in the actual game,
                        so I got a spot in the credits as a official participant.

                <div class="sub-article"> Our Studio
                </div>
                    <p> We started out as a group of 25 students that together worked on Bleeper during a course in Skövde. Most of us felt that the game had potential and decided
                        that we wanted to make a effort to complete it as a private venture, outside the school structure. Over the course of development the team was narrowed down
                         to a core of four people (myself included), with many of our previous participants working for us a s freelancers. We finished our demo and went to a couple
                         of expos with it and managed to score the best in show from Indie Games+ at Sweden Game Conference in 2018. Currently, we have our second game in pre-production
                         and are looking towards a retail release as early as winter 2020.
